// The session here is an ADMIN acting for the CONTEXT owner (`OWNER`): its own
// endpoint allowlist does not contain the context's data pods, so every read
// on the context's data plane (registration from `lws:partOf`, child
// registrations, existing access) is pre-read by the caller and handed in as
// `ShareContextFacts`. The tests pin that the build uses those facts — and
// that without them the session's own reads are used (personal context).
