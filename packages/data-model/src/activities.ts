// ──────────────────────────
// Activity types (the outbox) — payload-contract-alignment (amended wire)
//
// One interface per activity RDF class (capitalized). `type` is the
// discriminant: the class tuple `['Activity', '<Class>', <as:*>]` — the
// values compact from the `dataModelContext` term definitions when framed.
// Fields are FLAT plain IRIs/literals on the wire (storage law: no
// `{ id, type }` ref objects in SPARQL-queried registries) — `XId` refs
// appear only in the temporal inputs the handler builds from these.
//
// The class's primary object rides as `as:object` in one of two forms
// (the object-embedding amendment — the inventory is the wire truth):
//  - live link — a single `as:object <iri>` triple (the resource exists or
//    is pre-minted via `iriForContained` and materialized by the workflow);
//  - snapshot — a minted `urn:uuid` node embedding the full POJO projection
//    inline in the activity graph (id known only at write; never
//    dereferenced — the singly-fetched activity doc already contains it).
// Parties (`admin`, `authorizationGrantee`, `peerId`, role members) ride the
// object — they are NOT flat fields; consumers read them from the embedded
// or linked POJO.
//
// `AuthorizationRequested`/`ShareRequested` (the structure-based flat
// candidates) were DROPPED — authorization-granting.md Decision A settled
// the granting carrier as the term-covered `DataAuthorizationData` POJO(s)
// embedded on `AuthorizationGranted` (no RPC structure rides the wire).
