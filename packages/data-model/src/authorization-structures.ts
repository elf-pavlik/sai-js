// classes `AuthorizationRequested`/`ShareRequested` that could embed them
// were DROPPED (authorization-granting.md Decision A) — the granting carrier
// is the term-covered `DataAuthorizationData` POJO, so these structures are
// RPC-input types only, never on the wire.
// Fields stay domain-shaped plain-IRI strings — no `{ id, type }` refs,
// satisfying the storage law for SPARQL-queried registries.
