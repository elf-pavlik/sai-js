 * Activity class → fluent message key — the label map for the activity
 * indicator (step 0 of activity-first-services.md). One row per class the UI
 * claims: each step that adds an activity-first RPC adds its row here (the
 * "add their row to stay exhaustive" rule, like events.ts dispatch rows).
 * Fallback is the class name itself, so a missing row is visible in dev.
